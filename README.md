# 💾 Debugging: Inside the Machine

> “The system is failing. Glitches are spreading.  
> You are the last Debugger left inside the machine.”

## 🧠 BACKGROUND STORY

In the heart of a massive quantum mainframe, something has gone wrong.

Once a perfect network of logic and light, the **System** has begun to collapse under the weight of its own corrupted data.  
Glitches have appeared across the code, unstable nodes that flicker between truth and chaos.  
Viruses roam the circuitry, mutating, replicating, and corrupting everything they touch.

You are a **Debugger**, a digital avatar uploaded directly into the machine’s neural core.  
Your task is to **stabilize the network** before the collapse becomes irreversible.  
But time is short, and every misstep drains the machine’s stability.  

Only sharp logic, quick reflexes, and precision debugging can save the system.

## 🎮 GAME OVERVIEW

**Debugging: Inside the Machine** is a cyber-platformer about logic, precision, and survival.

Your goal is simple:  
**Fix all glitched nodes before the System collapses.**

- 🧩 **Glitches**: unstable data nodes that must be debugged.  
- 💀 **Viruses**: rogue code fragments that damage system stability.  
- ⚙️ **Platforms**: fragments of compiled logic holding the network together.  
- 💚 **System Stability**: your health - when it reaches 0%, the machine shuts down.

Each level becomes more complex as you dive deeper into the system - from the calm of early files to the chaos of the corrupted core.

## 🕹️ CONTROLS

| Action | Key(s) |
|--------|--------|
| Move | ← → or **A / D** |
| Jump | ↑ or **SPACE** |
| Enter Code Lens (inspect a glitch) | **C** |
| Choose Debug Option | **1, 2, 3, or 4** |
| Restart (after mission end) | **P** |

## 💡 GAMEPLAY LOOP

1. **Navigate the network.**  
   Move and jump between logic platforms to locate unstable data nodes.

2. **Use the Code Lens.**  
   When the **Code Lens** icon appears, press **C** to inspect nearby glitches.

3. **Analyze the code.**  
   A short debugging challenge will appear, a corrupted code snippet with four possible fixes.

4. **Avoid Glitches.**  
   Touching one instantly damages your stability and will send you back to your spawn point.
   
4. **Avoid Viruses.**  
   Touching one instantly damages your stability.

5. **Monitor System Stability.**  
   Your stability decreases over time and with each mistake. Keep it above 0% to survive.

6. **Win Condition.**  
   Repair all nodes to stabilize the system and restore the network.

## ⚔️ DIFFICULTY LEVELS

| Level | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Easy** | A clean sector with a few scattered glitches. Ideal for new Debuggers. |
| **Medium** | The corruption is spreading. Viruses are active and platforms unstable. |
| **Hard** | The Core itself is imploding! Dense chaos, moving enemies, and tight jumps. |

Each difficulty changes the network layout, the number of nodes, and the density of rogue code.

## 🧩 CODE LENS CHALLENGES

When inspecting a glitch, you’ll encounter snippets of corrupted code.  
Your job: **find the logical fix** that stabilizes the function.

Each question tests your debugging instincts.  
Mistakes hurt system stability, success restores it.

---

## ❤️ SYSTEM STABILITY

Your stability bar reflects the integrity of both you and the machine.  
- Starts at **100%**.  
- Decreases slowly over time.  
- Drops faster with collisions, wrong answers, or viruses.  
- Increases slightly for each repaired node.

When it reaches **0%**, the System collapses and you are derezzed.

## 🧮 RANKS & TITLES

Your final rank depends on your **accuracy**, **nodes repaired**, and **stability**:

| Rank | Title | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 **S-Rank: Kernel Guardian** | A flawless execution - you restored the machine’s core with precision and grace. |
| 🟢 **A-Rank: Core Debugger** | You contained the chaos and stabilized the network. A true professional. |
| 🟡 **B-Rank: Stack Tracer** | You fixed most of the system, but some errors persist. Promising work. |
| 🔴 **C-Rank: Glitch Magnet** | Too many logical faults - the machine survived, but barely. |

Your mission report at the end includes:
- **Nodes Fixed**
- **Nodes Attempted**
- **Accuracy**
- **System Stability (%)**
- **Final Rank**

## ⚠️ TIPS FROM THE NETWORK

- Don’t rush: observe the timing of viruses before moving.  
- Wait for the Code Lens prompt before touching a glitch.  
- The best Debuggers fix efficiently: **accuracy > speed**.  
- Stay stable, stay logical, and keep your processes clean.

## 🧠 FINAL MESSAGE

> “Every variable matters.  
> Every loop can break.  
> Every Debugger leaves a trace.”

Welcome to the machine.  
Stabilize it… or crash trying.
